        <p>What is the Economics?</p>
<p>I have traveled a long trip to find a deeper answer behind of this question. I think I did not get satisfactory one yet, and I still on the way to seek the real economics insights and training.</p>
<p>At this period, I am not sure which kind people I am, I have no idea. I try to find myself and love myself. You can view my <a href="https://ning.im/cv/">CV</a> and you may formally know more about me.</p>
<p>I like beer, cooking, travel and cars. I usually think aimlessly and am keen to do something meaningful.</p>

<h3 id="about-website">About Website</h3>
<p>This website is built by <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">Blogdown</a> in R and based on Hugo and I used model and frame from <a href="https://yihui.org">Yihui&rsquo;s</a> website. I love his thoughts about Internet and website building which would record your history and every step in modern Internet, but also people can preserve ideas from the past. Another reason is I want to public some interesting topic in research.</p>
<p>I am not good at coding, obviously, this website has some bugs that I cannot fix it.</p>
